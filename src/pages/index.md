## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Dev

- I'm currently working on the infra side of things at [100ms](https://www.100ms.live/).
- I recently wrote [Neralai, a live streaming media server](https://github.com/coder-with-a-bushido/neralai) from scratch, implementing the RFC spec for WHIP and HLS, which caught the attention of [the creator of pion WebRTC](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sean-dubois_webrtc-hls-media-activity-7071141433860112384-SMrU) himself ü§©
- I have written and am maintaining the [100ms server side SDK in Typescript](https://github.com/100mslive/server-sdks/tree/main/nodejs), with a focus on Developer Experience (DX).
- During my sophomore year of college, a friend and I built a landing site and a Scorehero-like app for [TDCA](https://tdca.in/#/), a local cricket association. We also developed an admin panel and assisted them in migrating all their paper-based data to digital format.
- I love building mini-projects for fun.

## üìù Writing

- I recently won [a content contest](https://twitter.com/invertaseio/status/1666425174462275584?s=20) for [a blog post on integrating a Dart custom lint package](https://medium.com/@coder-with-a-bushido/custom-lints-for-your-dart-flutter-project-9447a596c1f0), that had **0 documentation and had deprecated examples**.
- I love writing and can explain technical concepts to both a **5-year-old child** and a **20-year experienced developer**. Here are some cool ones I wrote:
  - [A tutorial-style blog](https://www.100ms.live/blog/migrate-twilio-to-100ms)
  - [A technical content blog](https://www.100ms.live/blog/webrtc-server-side)
  - [A technical product marketing blog](https://www.100ms.live/blog/vkyc-with-100ms)
- I have written **15+ technical blogs optimized for SEO and product marketing** at my current company. Collectively, they have over **18k+ sessions** with an average **on-page time of 8.23 minutes**. Several of these blogs are still among the **top 3 Google search results** for their respective keyphrases.

## üé≤ Other cool things
